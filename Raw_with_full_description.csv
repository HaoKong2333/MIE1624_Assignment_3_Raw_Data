About Harvest
Harvest is an industry-leading, independent software company that makes tools to help businesses run more smoothly. We believe that businesses only succeed by using their time intentionally. Our products support our customers through time tracking, reporting, and forecasting features.
Harvest started in 2006 as a team of three and has grown to today’s current team of almost 90 with Harvesters working from around the globe. We’ve worked as a remote team since the beginning and we continue to hire the right people for the job no matter where they call home.
We strive to create a workplace culture where everyone feels valued, included, and heard. One important aspect of this is continuing to create spaces for diverse life experiences and work histories. If you are a member of a group that is historically underrepresented and disadvantaged in tech, business, and society in general, we want to meet you and we encourage you to apply.
Why We’re Hiring
We are looking for a Data Analyst to uplevel Harvest’s business and product insights, developing reporting and data visualizations that inform strategic decisions throughout the entire Harvest organization.
In this role, you will leverage your technical skills to synthesize and analyze data, then present your findings via clear and consumable reporting that ensures understanding and elevates data literacy.
To be successful in this role, you must be an exceptional communicator, capable of translating complex ideas into actionable insights and presenting to all levels of the organization. You must have strong technical abilities, with expertise in SQL, Python and R combined with strong analytical skills.


What You’ll Do:
Collaborate with internal stakeholders to establish KPIs and develop clear, consumable reporting. Help partners flesh out their questions, diving deeper and presenting your findings to them at the appropriate level of granularity and detail.
Synthesize data from a variety of sources to develop and present reporting and data visualizations that drive understanding and inform action for Harvesters at every level of the organization.
Leverage your extensive SQL knowledge to query and analyze data; when more advanced analysis is required, use Python or R to explore, visualize and analyze data while codifying business logic using DBT (Data Build Tool) and automating reports using Mode, our BI tool of choice.
Cultivate a nuanced understanding of Harvest’s data and lead research to uncover the questions we don’t know we should be asking, both for our business and product.
Improve our data systems by collaborating with colleagues across Harvest to continue to expand and centralize our knowledge into DBT while ensuring stakeholders understand how to access this knowledge.
Requirements
Appetite and effort to stay up to date on the latest trends
Strong attention to detail with an analytical mind to problem-solve
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Proven ability to visualize data in a way that increases understanding

A competitive base pay: The salary for this role is $165,000 in USD. Every Harvester with the same role expectations receives the same base pay. And we aim to pay at the top of the market (informed by third-party data) for all roles.
Individual and company performance bonus plans: We believe in rewarding performance, so all Harvesters are eligible to receive an individual and company performance bonus after working with Harvest for a period of time.
Competitive benefits*: We offer a number of benefits, including
15 days of vacation in your first year, plus company holidays and a week off for winter break. And you’ll get an additional two days per year until you reach twenty days.

_ERP Business Intelligence Analyst
We are seeking an ERP-focused business intelligence analyst to join our team and expand our capacity to meet the demands of our growing client base. In this role, you will create best-in-class data dashboards and other data tools for public sector leaders, while working with a talented team of data practitioners with whom you will collaborate and learn from.
The ERP BI analyst will specialize in designing data tools using human resources (HR) and financial data, including tools to support public sector leaders in budget development, payroll monitoring, procurement tracking, managing hiring and vacancies, and other key HR/finance functions.
Open Architects (OA) is a Massachusetts-based organization that supports school districts, municipalities, and education non-profits by providing visualization dashboards to give leaders the information they need to make data-informed decisions. OA’s dashboards seamlessly collect, combine, transform, analyze, and display data from disparate data sources to provide insights to school district and municipal leaders. Staffed by former practitioners, OA creates the analytical tools and provides the insights that we wish we had when we worked in districts and municipalities.
In our sixth year of operation, OA provides an open, collaborative team environment, where diverse perspectives and backgrounds are valued. We are driven by a deep sense of service to our clients and the students and citizens they serve, and eagerly get into the trenches to help solve our clients’ problems. We are also a learning organization that embraces the messiness of the work and has fun along the way. We take our work seriously but not ourselves.
ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES
As part of a dynamic, growing startup, you will report to OA’s director in charge of client engagements and dashboard analytics, collaborate frequently with other OA team members, and serve on the project teams for multiple clients. We work remotely and maintain a strong team culture through frequent meetings, quarterly step-backs, and an annual in-person retreat.
Our ideal candidate is passionate about helping leaders use data to develop a more holistic view of their organization and improve decision-making using real-time data. The right individual will have a problem-solving mindset and will use his/her analytic and artistic capabilities to create dynamic visualizations. He or she is also a pragmatist who can put his/herself into the shoes of education, public sector and non-profit leaders who need simple, intuitive data displays to understand trends, drill down into problem areas, and celebrate successes.
Our tools are built to intentionally address the challenges that public-sector and non-profit leaders face on a daily, monthly, and annual basis. You will be creating and adapting visualization tools that bring together finance/HR data sources, including budget and payroll monitoring, hiring and vacancies, educator licensure, and other data domains.
A typical task for this role would involve identifying relevant data tables from an ERP system to be used in a new dashboard project; building an intuitive, interactive dashboard in PowerBI that displays financial data including graphs, charts, and filters; presenting the dashboard to the client; and refining the dashboard based on feedback. Over the course of a project, the ERP BI analyst will create a suite of dashboards that will provide the client with a robust view of their financial and staffing data across multiple domains.

Purpose: Some of us worked in energy before, some of us haven’t. All of us would like to make a difference and do our part in helping the world move towards a more resilient grid run on renewable energy.

Fun: We work hard, but enjoy our time at work as well as outside of work. With the team spread out over multiple time zones we also embraced flexibility early on, and are focused on results instead of time spent in the office.

To this end, in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), FPHNYC incubates innovative public health initiatives implemented by DOHMH to advance community health throughout the city. It facilitates partnerships, often new and unconventional, between government and the private sector to develop, test, and launch new initiatives. These collaborations speed the execution of demonstration projects, effect expansion of successful pilot programs, and support rapid implementation to meet the public health needs of individuals, families, and communities across New York City.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW (Division of Disease Control)
Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. DOHMH strives to protect and promote the health of all New Yorkers. With a vision to be a city where all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, where they are from or where they live, our core values are science, equity, and compassion.

A world-renowned public health agency responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic, DOHMH has been a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and resource. From food policy, tobacco, HIV/AIDS, family child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial justice work, DOHMH’s impact to public policy across the nation has been vast.

Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity, DOHMH has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling the impact of racism on the health of New Yorkers and more broadly. In 2021, the New York City Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity, and access, DOHMH continues to work in and with communities with historic disinvestment and disease burden to decrease unfair and avoidable health outcomes so all New Yorkers can achieve their full health potential.

Ocean Associates Inc. (OAI) is seeking applicants for a full-time position to provide ecosystem reporting support to the Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, within NOAA Fisheries. OAI is a Virginia corporation established in 2003 that provides consulting and technical services to the U.S. government, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and the private sector. We specialize in scientific program and project management, strategic planning, professional and technical services and stakeholder engagement, supporting government contracts.
Description:
NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for the conservation and management of our Nation’s living marine resources and their habitats. By developing high quality science and supporting an ecosystem-based approach to management, NMFS provides important services to the Nation, including sustainable fisheries, healthy ecosystems, safe seafood, and protected species recovery.
The U.S. leads the world in sustainable fisheries management; as a result, U.S. fisheries are highly valuable and make large contributions to the U.S. economy. Under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), NMFS works with the eight regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs) to provide scientific advice on the ~500 federally-managed fish stocks. NMFS stock assessments and other science products are critically important to sustainable fisheries management for assessing the status of fish stocks and predicting future harvest levels, setting sustainable catch limits, and reducing bycatch.
NMFS recently codified its commitment to Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) with the release of their EBFM policy and subsequent EBFM Roadmap. The EBFM Policy establishes a framework of guiding principles to “enhance and accelerate the implementation of EBFM within NOAA Fisheries, and in cooperation with NOAA Fisheries partners.” These guiding principles are: implement ecosystem-level planning, advancing our understanding of ecosystem processes, prioritizing vulnerabilities and risk of ecosystems and their components, explore and address trade-offs within an ecosystem, incorporate ecosystem considerations into management advice, and maintain resilient ecosystems.
The Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch (EDAB) conducts a research program focused on developing ecosystem-level knowledge and advice to support informed decision-making. Research conducted by the Branch encompasses climate science, ecology, process-oriented ecosystem research, and marine population dynamics and ecosystem modeling.
The Branch is responsible for conducting analyses of the effects of natural and anthropogenic pressures on the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES LME). EDAB also develops and applies ecosystem and statistical models to synthesize information on climate, oceanographic, and human-related pressures. These products are provided to a variety of entities to inform decision-making and to support the implementation of regional and national EBFM. These entities include NOAA, other federal and state agencies, Regional Fishery Management Councils (hereafter, Councils), Marine Fisheries Commissions, research colleagues, nongovernmental organizations, national and international treaty organizations in which the U.S. participates, and the fishing industry (both commercial and recreational).
One of the focal areas of EDAB is Ecosystem Reporting where this position will be focused. The Branch develops several documents reporting ecosystem status and trends (e.g., State of the Ecosystem reports for the two regional councils, Ecosystem Status Report, Current Conditions, Ecosystem Context for Stock Advice, and others). These documents provide climate, environmental, and ecosystem considerations targeted to specific audiences to support individual stock advice, specification setting, and as general communication tools to the general public. Collectively, these documents serve as the backbone of Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEAs). The reports describe environmental, social, and economic states and their potential impacts on commercially important fish species, protected species, and the NES LME. These synthesis products are important in supporting ecosystem-level advice critical to NMFS, Councils, stakeholders, and other decision-makers.
Data used in ecosystem reporting incorporates a wide range of disciplines. These reports typically contain climate and oceanographic information such as global climate and regional model outputs, satellite sea surface temperature and ocean color data, as well as observations from ongoing hydrographic and plankton surveys. They also contain relevant data from other fisheries independent and dependent sources such as fish and protected species surveys, and commercial landings data. Ecosystem reporting also attempts to capture human dimensions through social and economic data related to Northeast U.S. Coastal communities.
Additionally, the Branch supports a defined process for evaluating and operationalizing new analyses and data for inclusion in ecosystem reporting products to improve generality, accessibility, testing, documentation, and best practices.
Tasks:
The task includes the following:
Coordinate and facilitate implementation of ecosystem reporting projects.Organize and facilitate workshops as needed.
Assist with planning and logistics of program and project team meetings/workshops and help develop agendas, written documents, meeting minutes, presentations, or other materials as required.

Assist with the development and maintenance of automated procedures to improve efficiency throughout the ecosystem reporting process (e.g., data collection and processing, report generation, metadata collection).
Assist with the development and maintenance of web interfaces for disseminating ecosystem data and reports.
Ensure adherence to NOAA data policies and Public Access to Research Results guidance.
Prioritize and organize implementation of recommendations from Clients (i.e., Regional Fishery Management Organizations).

1 in 5 students has a learning disability such as dyslexia, which makes it harder for them to read, spell and write-despite their intelligence. While receiving a proper evaluation for a learning disability could be the most impactful event in a student's life, only 4% of students receive a diagnosis because of the high costs of evaluations and lack of access to qualified psychologists. Undiagnosed students are 3x more likely to drop out of high school, 5x more likely to be unemployed, and tend to experience elevated levels of anxiety and depression. It's estimated that early diagnosis of dyslexia and other learning disabilities could save the US over 72 billion dollars of economic impact and drastically improve the lives of millions of people.
Marker Learning is on a mission to make learning disability (e.g. dyslexia) assessments and diagnosis easier and more affordable for schools and parents. By leveraging proprietary technology developed by leading experts at Johns Hopkins, the end-to-end evaluation is completed in half the time and at 1/10th the cost of typical in person evaluations. We are a rapidly growing start up, backed by some of the most mission driven and reputable venture capital firms and education non-profits.
